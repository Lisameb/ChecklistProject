# ChecklistProject

The project starts at de.thu.project.main/StartProject.java.


**To be able to run this you need to make sure that:**

* Driver in /jar subfolder is listed in external libraries path.
* Subfolder /img and /src in class path.
* Make a Config.java file under \src\util with these variables:

>package util;
>
>public class Config {  
>  public static final String URL = *insert db URL*;    
>  public static final String USER = *insert db username*;    
>  public static final String PASSWORD = *insert db password*;      
>}

(the values for the variables can be found in our other readme in our WorkProducts folder)
